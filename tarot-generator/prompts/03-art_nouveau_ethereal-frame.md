FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Art Nouveau Ethereal

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Continuous flowing vine with lilies (Mucha-style) forming organic arch
      - Left border: Vertical rose vine climbing upward (18px wide)
      - Right border: Mirror image of left vine (18px wide, symmetrical)
      - Top: Semicircular halo design with zodiac-inspired sun rays (25px height)
      - Bottom: Curved art nouveau cartouche for card title with lily motif (80x20px)
      - Corner decorations: Four identical stylized lily blooms
      - Color: Sage green (#9DC183) vines, dusty rose (#D4A5A5) flowers, gold (#C9A227) accents
      - Line weight: Consistent 2px organic curves throughout
      - All decorative elements must flow seamlessly and be perfectly symmetrical

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Sage green, dusty rose, gold, cream, soft lavender

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Art Nouveau Ethereal style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
