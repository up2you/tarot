FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Watercolor Dreams

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Delicate gold foil (#D4AF37) thin line (1.5px) with soft watercolor bleed effect
      - Corner decorations: Four identical soft watercolor wash triangles in blush pink (20x20px)
      - Top center: Gentle curved arc with small gold dots (50x12px)
      - Bottom center: Soft watercolor cloud shape for card title in elegant calligraphy (80x18px)
      - Left/Right borders: Subtle lavender watercolor gradient fading inward (8px wide)
      - Inner border: Soft white vignette effect toward center
      - Tiny gold foil dots scattered at even intervals along border (12 dots per side)
      - Color: Soft blush (#FFB6C1), dusty blue (#6699CC), gold foil, lavender (#E6E6FA)
      - All watercolor effects must appear organic but be symmetrically placed

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Soft blush, dusty blue, sage, lavender, gold foil

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Watercolor Dreams style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
