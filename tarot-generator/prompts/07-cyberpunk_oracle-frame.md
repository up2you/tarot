FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Cyberpunk Oracle

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Chrome metallic (#C0C0C0) with circuit board trace pattern (15px)
      - Corner decorations: Four identical hexagonal tech nodes with LED glow effect
      - Top center: Holographic triangle with scanning lines (40x25px)
      - Bottom center: Digital LCD display panel for card title with hex code texture (100x20px)
      - Left/Right borders: Vertical data stream lines in cyan (#00FFFF) (12px wide)
      - Small glitch effect bars at random-but-identical positions on both sides
      - Inner border: Neon glow line (2px cyan outer, 1px magenta (#FF00FF) inner)
      - Color: Black (#000000), neon cyan (#00FFFF), hot magenta (#FF00FF), chrome
      - All digital elements must be perfectly symmetrical

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Neon cyan, hot magenta, electric blue, black, chrome silver

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Cyberpunk Oracle style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
