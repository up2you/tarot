FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Art Deco Luxe

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Black (#000000) with triple-line gold (#FFD700) stepped pattern (20px total)
      - Corner decorations: Four identical geometric fan/sunburst motifs (30x30px)
      - Top center: Triangular chevron pointing up with Egyptian winged sun disk (50x25px)
      - Bottom center: Geometric cartouche with stepped edges for card title (100x22px)
      - Inner border: Single gold line (2px) with small diamond accents at midpoints
      - Side borders: Vertical chevron pattern in gold on black (15px wide each)
      - All lines MUST be perfectly straight and angular (no curves)
      - Perfect bilateral symmetry required

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Black, gold, silver, emerald, ruby, sapphire

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Art Deco Luxe style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
