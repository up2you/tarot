FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Dark Fantasy

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Weathered dark iron (#2D2D2D) with aged patina texture (18px)
      - Corner decorations: Four identical gothic pointed arch finials with thorny roses
      - Left/Right borders: Intertwined thorny vines with small dark roses (15px wide)
      - Top: Gothic pointed arch with central skull motif and bat wings (35px height)
      - Bottom: Dark stone plaque for card title with cracked texture (90x22px)
      - Inner border: Thin silver (#C0C0C0) line with small arcane runes at intervals
      - Small purple gemstones at four corners (5px diameter)
      - Color: Deep purple (#301934), midnight black, blood red (#8B0000) accents
      - All thorns and vines must be identical and symmetrical

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Deep purple, midnight black, blood red, silver, ghostly blue

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Dark Fantasy style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
