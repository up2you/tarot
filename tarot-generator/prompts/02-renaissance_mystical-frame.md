FULL-BLEED DECORATIVE FRAME TEMPLATE - Renaissance Mystical

Create a decorative picture frame that FILLS THE ENTIRE IMAGE CANVAS.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The frame's OUTER EDGE must touch ALL FOUR SIDES of the image - NO background visible
- NO margin, NO background, NO base layer outside the frame
- The frame itself IS the entire image - there is nothing behind it
- The CENTER area must be COMPLETELY WHITE/BLANK for content overlay

EXACT BORDER SPECIFICATION (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON ALL CARDS):
      - Outer frame: Marble-textured classical columns on left and right sides (20px wide)
      - Top: Renaissance arch with gold leaf triangular pediment (30px height)
      - Bottom: Stone base with carved Roman numerals placeholder (20px height)
      - Corner decorations: Four identical classical acanthus capitals
      - Inner border: Thin gold leaf line (3px) with aged parchment texture
      - Title area: Classical cartouche at bottom center (100x20px)
      - Color: Warm ivory (#FFFEF0) columns with gold (#D4AF37) accents
      - All elements MUST be architecturally symmetrical

COLOR PALETTE FOR FRAME:
Ultramarine blue, vermillion, gold leaf, earth tones, soft ivory

FRAME STRUCTURE (from outside to inside):
1. OUTER EDGE: Decorative border elements at the VERY EDGE of the canvas (no gap, no margin)
2. MAIN FRAME: Ornate Renaissance Mystical style decorative border
3. INNER EDGE: Transition to the empty center area
4. CENTER: Pure WHITE empty rectangle (approximately 70% of image) for card content

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE:
- The decorative frame border MUST START AT THE VERY EDGE of the image
- There must be NO visible background or base layer OUTSIDE the frame
- The frame elements should TOUCH the image boundaries on all sides
- NO floating frame on a background - the frame IS the entire image
- Center must be solid WHITE for Photoshop transparency selection
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- Perfectly symmetrical left-to-right
- All four corner decorations must be IDENTICAL
- Include a title plate/cartouche at bottom center for card name
